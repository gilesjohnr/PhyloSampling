The project is set up by using four main scripts in the `R` folder:

  1. load.R: Loads all packages and data sets. Include brief decriptions. Simple/important subsetting or edits can go here if necessary.

  2. clean.R: Code thats hacks its way through a task for the first time---does not have to be pretty. Divide code chunks based on purpose and annotate generously.

  3. func.R: Once a discrete task is working well in `clean.R`, it is moved here and made into a general function that can be called easily. All functions and their arguments must have descriptions.

  4. do.R: This where the functions from the `func.R` script are called and higher-level actions are performed. Figures are made here too. Annotate what each analysis/code chuck is doing.
